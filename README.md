# Object-oriented-Programming-Challenge

This is a command-line application that generates SVG logos based on user input.  The application supports various shapes such as Triangle, Circle, and Square.  For this project I used Node, inquirer and fs to run the application, prompt all questionsm retrieve the information needed, and generate a new SVG logo, which can be run using the browser.

## Installation:
* Clone the repository to local machine,
* Navigate using the command line into the directory with the index.js file.
* Run "npm init -y"
* Check if most up to date Inquirer.js is installed.
* check if most up to date Jest is installed.

## Usage Instructions
